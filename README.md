Description:

A tool, that when used, will switch automatically based on the block that you're hitting.

The tools are stored in an external inventory that the player can open anywhere.

The purpose of this plugin is to make mining easier and to save space in the player's inventory.

Commands:

/multitool [open / toggle / reload]

"multitool" shortened as "mt". ex: /mt open

"open" shortened as "o". ex: /mt o

"toggle" shortened as "t". ex: /mt t

"reload" cannot be shortened.

Permissions:

multitool.use (lets the player use the multitool in their hand)

multitool.command (lets the player execute the multitool commands)

multitool.reload (lets the player reload the multitool config)

In-depth knowledge:

The tools in the multitool inventory can be changed by doing /multitool open (/mt open, /multitool o, /mt o). Items can be dropped into their respective slots. The multitool can be given to the player by clicking the feather on the far right of the inventory.

If the player doesn't want their multitool to change automatically, but instead be stuck on their current tool, they can type /multitool toggle (/multitool t, /mt toggle, /mt t)

If the player only wants to put a shovel and a sword in their multitool, the multitool will only have those two tools available.

if the player tries removing the multitool from their inventory in any manner, the multitool will be destroyed, but can be gotten again by clicking the feather in the /mt o inventory.

Any type material of tool can be put in the multitool inventory. Only works for sword, pick, axe, and shovel though
